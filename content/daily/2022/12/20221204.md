## [漢羅] Video: Powers of Ten
How different does the universe look on very small scales?>

On very large scales?>

The most famous short science film of its generation gives breathtaking comparisons.>

That film, Powers of Ten, originally created in the 1960s, has been officially posted to YouTube and embedded here.>

From a picnic blanket near Chicago out past the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, every ten seconds the film zooms out to show a square a factor of ten times larger on each side.>

The 9-minute video then reverses, zooming back in a factor of ten every two seconds and ends up inside a single proton.>

The Powers of Ten sequence is actually based on the book Cosmic View by Kees Boeke in 1957, as is a similar but mostly animated film Cosmic Zoom that was also created in the late 1960s.>

The changing perspectives are so enthralling and educational that sections have been recreated using more modern computerized techniques, including the first few minutes of the movie Contact.>

Ray and husband Charles Eames, the film's creators, were known as quite visionary spirits and even invented their own popular chair.
